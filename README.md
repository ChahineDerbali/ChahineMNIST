# ChahineMNIST

ChahineMNIST is an Android application that uses a custom-trained **TensorFlow Lite** model to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from images taken with the device’s camera. The model is trained on my own handwriting using **Google's Teachable Machine**, making it personalized and accurate for my digit style.

## 📱 Features

- Capture handwritten digits with your phone camera
- Real-time digit prediction using on-device ML
- Model trained on custom handwriting samples
- Lightweight and fast thanks to TensorFlow Lite

## 🎥 Based On

This project was originally inspired by the tutorial from **IJ Apps**:
